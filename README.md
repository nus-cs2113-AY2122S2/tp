# Airline Reservation and Check-in System (ARCS)

This is a greenfield Java project by CS2113 Group AY2122s2-CS2113-F12-3. It's named Airline Reservation and Check-in System (ARCS). Given below are instructions on how to use it.

## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 11 (use the exact version), update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. **Ensure Intellij JDK 11 is defined as an SDK**, as described [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) -- this step is not needed if you have used JDK 11 in a previous Intellij project.
   * In the same dialog, you _may have to set the Project language level_ field to the SDK default option.
2. **Import the project _as a Gradle project_**, as described [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).
3. **Verify the set up**: After the importing is complete, locate the `src\main\java\arcs\Main.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Main.main()`. If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below:
   ```
   > Task :compileJava
   > Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
   > Task :classes
   
   > Task :Main.main()
   Hello! Welcome to ARCS system.
   What can I do for you?
   ```
   Type some word and press enter to let the execution proceed to the end.

## Build automation using Gradle

## Testing

### I/O redirection tests

* To run _I/O redirection_ tests (aka _Text UI tests_), navigate to the `text-ui-test` and run the `runtest(.bat/.sh)` script.

### JUnit tests

* A skeleton JUnit test (`src/test/java/seedu/duke/DukeTest.java`) is provided with this project template. 
* If you are new to JUnit, refer to the [JUnit Tutorial at se-education.org/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/junit.html).
