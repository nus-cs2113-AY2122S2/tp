##Project: Hotel Lite

Hotel Lite - A convenient tool for hotel owners to manage their businesses.
The user interacts with it using a CLI. It is written in Java and has about 7kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**: Added the add items command to the item list.
  * What it does: allows the user to add a new item and its pax to the item list.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to add an item and its pax into the item list when a new item has been added to the 
  hotel inventory hence ensuring that the item list accurately reflects the hotel's inventory.


* **New Feature**: Updating of the item pax in the item list.
  * What it does: allows the user to update the pax of the item to reflect the new pax of that item in the inventory 
  whenever an existing item is added to the inventory or when one pax of an existing item is taken out.
    * Eg, currently there are 15 dove shampoos within the inventory, when 1 is taken out of the inventory to replenish a
    room, the user can use the update item pax command to reduce the pax of dove shampoos from 15 to 14 in the item list.
  * Justification: This feature  allows the user to update the pax of items that have been added / remove from the 
  inventory ensuring that the item list accurately reflects the inventory.


* **New Feature**: Updating of the item name in the item list.
  * What it does: allows the user to update the name of the item to reflect the new name of that item in the inventory
    whenever the name of an existing item is changed in the inventory.
    * Eg, the product was originally called dove shampoo but now the company has changed the shampoo name to be 
    dove coconut and hydration shampoo. Hence, the user can change the item name within the item list from dove 
    shampoo to dove coconut and hydration shampoo.
  * Justification: This feature  allows the user to update the name of items in the item list ensuring that the item 
  list accurately reflects the inventory.


* **New Feature**: Viewing all items in the item list.
  * What it does: allows the users to view all the items within the item list.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to quickly and easily see what are the items currently within the 
  inventory as well as its pax.


* **New Feature**: View all the items in the item list that has a pax of zero.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all the items within the item list that has a pax of zero with a single command.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to quickly and easily see what are the items within the inventory that has run out
  so that the user can replenish them inorder to ensure that the inventory is well stocked up.
  * Highlight: Able to quickly identify all the items with a pax of zero instead of having to scroll through all the items within the item list.


* **New Feature**: Search item within the item list.
  * What it does: allows the user to search for an item within the item list using a keyword.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to quickly check the inventory to see if it stores a particular item.
  * Highlight: Able to search for an item quickly by entering an item name partially as the keyword instead entering the full item name.

* **New Feature**: Delete item within the item list.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete an item within the item list.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to easily delete a particular item from the item list whenever 
  the hotel no longer stocks up that item. This allows the item list to accurate reflect the contents of the inventory.
