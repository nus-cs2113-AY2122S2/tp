## Overview
**Project: MeetingJio**

MeetingJio is a program written in Java for finding potential time slots for team meetings
based on everyoneâ€™s availability via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast, 
MeetingJio can get your meeting management tasks done faster than manually eyeballing your timetable.

Below are my contributions to the project
## Summary of features contributed:

### Delete feature
- Delete specific event of either type meeting or lesson from timetable of a specific user.
- If a meeting is deleted, then that specific event is deleted from all users.
Otherwise, it will only be deleted for that user. 

### Clear feature

- Allows to clear a user and his timetable or all timetables in a glance.
- This allows a user to be cleared or to start the program afresh.

### Add meeting feature
- Allows meeting to be added for to the timetable all users added in
- This allows the team to have a copy and keep track of their timetable.

## Other contributions
### Parser methods, JUnit and Integration testing
- Implemented parser for prepareDelete,prepareAddMeeting
- Added error and exception handling
- Performed JUnit testing for commands implemented 
- Did integration testing for all features implemented and ensure program was cohesive.
