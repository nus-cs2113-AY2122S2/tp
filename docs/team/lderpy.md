* ***New Feature*** : View command
  * What it does: The view command allowed users to view a Good inside the warehouse
  with more details than what the list command provided.
  * Justification: The Good contains many details which may clutter the screen if they were all provided when
  listing all the goods out. Hence, we decided to omit some details to lower clutter but enabled one to view
  all the details with this command instead.
