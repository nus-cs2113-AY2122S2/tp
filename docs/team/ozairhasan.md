## Overview
AlloNUS (“All On Us”) is an all-in-one platform
for tracking your classes, expenses, and personal contacts
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, AlloNUS can get your schedule, expenses,
and contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
