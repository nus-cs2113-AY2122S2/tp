## Overview

**Project: MeetingJio**

MeetingJio is a program written in Java for finding potential time slots for team meetings
based on everyone’s availability via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast,
MeetingJio can get your meeting management tasks done faster than manually eyeballing your timetable.

## Summary of Contributions

- Wrote the code to create a text file in the local machine and write all the data to the text file
when the user exits the application.
