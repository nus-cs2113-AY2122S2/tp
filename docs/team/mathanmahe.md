* Enhancement: Parse .ics file from nusmods.com
  * What it does: Parses ics file that contains an NUS students academic schedule then adds all the modules to the list instantly.
  * Justification: Allows the user to instantly add their schedule to the module list without having to key in using individual add commands.
  The implementation was challenging as it required me to debug existing library dependency errors and resolve them.
  This is an extra feature that is meant for better user experience as it saves time.
