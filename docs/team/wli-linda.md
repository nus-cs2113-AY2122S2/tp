## Overview
AlloNUS (“All On Us”) is an all-in-one platform
for tracking your classes, expenses, and personal contacts
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, AlloNUS can get your schedule, expenses,
and contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions
* **New Features**: Added Contacts Manager features
  * `add`, `rm`, `list`,`edit`, and `find`
  * What it does: provide users with basic features needed to manage their contacts
  * Justification: NUS students have the need to manage their contacts. Adding, removing, 
  showing, editing, and finding contacts allow user to build a list
  of contacts and conveniently manage them.
  * Highlights: `add` and `edit` commands use the same method in the parser
  to update the fields of contacts. Methods are sufficiently modularized and
  significant repetition in code is generally avoided.
* **Code Contributed**: [Reposense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=wli-linda&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=wli-linda&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2113-F10-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
