## Overview
**Project: MeetingJio**

MeetingJio is a program written in Java for finding potential time slots for team meetings
based on everyoneâ€™s availability via a Command Line Interface (CLI). If you can type fast,
MeetingJio can get your meeting management tasks done faster than manually eyeballing your timetable.
