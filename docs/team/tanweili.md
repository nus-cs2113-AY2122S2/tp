## Overview
HALPMI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) Application that allows administrators in clinics to manage the clinic's day-to-day
administrative tasks. More specifically, using HALPMI the user is able to insert new information regarding Doctors, Patients
and Medication. Users can also schedule appointment for Patients with Doctors and keep track of medication stocks.
## Summary of Contributions

**Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tanweili&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-02-18&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)

**Enhancements implemented:**
<br>
I helped to implement the initial code logic and exceptions for adding and deleting patients using the Patient and
PatientList classes. I implemented most of the initial Appointment and AppointmentList classes, and integrated them
with the codebase to add, delete, find and view. Next, I implemented the feature that checks that the given patient
and doctor exists before adding them into the AppointmentList.

This feature is pivotal for the product because it prevents the user from adding in non-existent patients and/or
doctors into the appointments and improves the functionality of the product as a whole.

**UG contributions:**
I helped to keep our UG updated as much as possible as our code evolved, by updating the command format and examples as
needed.
<br>
<br>
**DG contributions:**
I implemented the class diagrams for Appointment,AppointmentList,Medicine, and MedicineList and added in descriptions
for them in the DG. I also helped to make small changes to our DG as our code evolved, such as changing the required
command inputs in the appendix. I also helped to update the class diagrams by removing the default class and 
method/variable icons, to adhere to the UML diagram standards given. I did the design implementation section regarding
the view appointment command.
<br>
<br>
**Team-based tasks contributions:**
I helped to set up the milestones and labels on Github issues. I also helped to release V2.0 and kept it updated as
much as possible prior to its deadline. I used the issue tracker as much as possible, by tagging the appropriate
labels and milestones. I closed a significant portion of the bugs from PE dry run by updating the code to address the
bugs where needed.
<br>
<br>
**Review contributions:**
I helped to review some of my teammates PRs, giving comments and suggestions where I thought was appropriate.
