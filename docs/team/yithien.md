## Project: AlloNUS

AlloNUS (“All On Us”) is an all-in-one platform
for tracking your classes, expenses, and personal contacts
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
If you can type fast, AlloNUS can get your schedule, expenses,
and contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature:** Added the Expense Tracker module for AlloNUS
    - What it does:
      - `add`, `rm`, `list`,`edit`, and `find`
          - Allows the user to better track their expenses by adding expense records to a list.
            Each record details the Date, Amount, Category and Remarks of the expense, allowing users to look back
            at how much they have spent over time.
          - Allows users to manage said list by giving options to delete, edit and look for records containing
            specified keywords.
    - Justification:
        - The features above allows user to keep track of their expenses in a systematic way without the need of
          remembering it manually.
        - The ability to edit and delete records improves the product significantly as end-users tend to make
          mistakes when typing in commands, so an effective way to correct these mistakes need to be implemented.
    - Highlights:
        - This module works in conjunction with 2 other modules under the umbrella of AlloNUS, which relies on an
          overall runner to switch between the 3 modules. This required an overall design to be in place before
          writing out each module individually.
