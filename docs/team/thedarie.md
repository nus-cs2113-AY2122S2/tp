Summary of code contributions:
- Used a JSON library to facilitate the `Storage` component of the application.
    - Implemented the translation of `Task` to a JSON string and vice versa.
    - Implemented the writing of tasks currently in the application to a JSON file on disk.
    - Implemented the loading of save files into the application.
    - Implemented handling of invalid save data.
- Wrote some functions in `TaskParser` that processes user input to prepare execution of given command.
- Implemented recurring tasks feature that allows user to have a task repeat at regular intervals.
    - Handled and implemented the logic of how recurring tasks should be added, deleted and edited.
    - Implemented the `HashSet` data structure in `TaskList` to keep track of the task identifiers.
    - Implemented the `Frequency` enumeration to identify the interval of which tasks should be repeated.
- Added JUnit tests for Storage, TaskParser and StorageParser class.
- Added JavaDoc comments for most methods that I wrote.
- Refactored code related to `Storage` and `Task` components on multiple occasions to achieve better code quality.
