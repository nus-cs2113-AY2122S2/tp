| Contribution                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Add Medicine                            | Feature that allows user to add medicines into the application.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| View Medicine                           | Feature that allows user to view all medicines in the list.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Edit Medicine                           | Feature that allows user to edit existing medicines                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Update Medicine                         | Feature that allows user to update medicine inventory to check for expired medicines as well as medicine that have run out.                                                                                                                                 |
| Assign Medicine                         | Feature that allows user to assign medications to patients who have appointments on that day. The user can request for certain medicines to be dispensed to the patient. HalpMi will show the list of medicines to dispense with the batch id and quantity. |
| Storage Class                           | Implemented storage class that holds all data (Patient, Doctor, Medicines, Appointments). Holds methods that load data from and save data to CSV files.                                                                                                     |
| Refactoring Command Class               | Initially our command class had static methods and was not showing good implementation of OOP principles. Hence I refactored the code to include abstract command class and various children classes for different commands available.                      |
| Other code corrections and improvements | Along the way there were various bugs and issues found with code that I have helped to correct as well.                                                                                                                                                     |
| JUnit Code                              | Contributed significantly to JUnit code for many methods that I was involved in creating.                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Other Contributions

### **User Guide**

Contributed to User Guide by setting up clear formatting in the initial iteration of drafting the UG. In the following
iterations, contributed by adding in the details of the various features implemented in HalpMi.

### **Developer Guide**

Contributed to Dev Guide by setting up the format in the early iterations of the Developer Guide.
Created the overall Sequence Diagram to show overall flow of logic. Also created a high-level design model of HalpMi.
Explained the usage and logic of the Storage Class and its methods with reference to Class Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams.
Explained on the implementation of features such as "Update Medicine" and "Assign Medicine" in the guide as well.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project I was better able to appreciate the various tools such as IDEs, Gradle and Git that are available to
Software Engineers. The module gave insights on how these tools can help makes one's life easier especially when working on
a single product as a team. The project has also allowed me to learn key OOP principles and how good usage of OOP can lead
to a cohesive and less coupled app. This would make the code a joy to read for other developers and oneself alike.

In conclusion, this module has been an eye-opener into the world of software engineering and through this project and my
contributions I was able to gain much knowledge that would really come handy in the workforce!
