#### New Features
* [Session Create](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/SessionCreateCommand.java)
  * What it does: Allows users to create sessions in the application.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to record the details of their outing and keep track of the expenditure of each activity.
* [Session Delete](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/SessionDeleteCommand.java)
  * What it does: Allows users to delete sessions in the application.
  * Justification: This feature allows users to remove unnecessary sessions that were previously created.
* [Session Edit](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/SessionEditCommand.java) 
  * What it does: Allows users to edit previously created sessions.
  * Justification: This features allows users to amend a mistake previously made when creating a session.
  * Highlights: This was challenging as the edits made had to be crossed check with existing sessions within the application.
                In addition, the supplied person list for the edit had to contain the existing persons in the session.
* [Session List](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/command/SessionListCommand.java)
  * What it does: Allows users to view all previously created sessions.
  * Justification: This features allows users to see a list of all the outings that were recorded.
* [Manager](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/data/Manager.java)
  * Contains an instance of `Profile`, `Storage` and `TextUI` to support commands within SplitLah.
* [Profile](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/data/Profile.java)
  * The `Profile` class serves as a container and holds a list of all `Session` and `Group` objects created by the user.
  * It also keeps track of and issues new _unique identifiers_ for the creation of `Session`, `Activity` and `Group` objects.
* [Storage](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/storage/Storage.java)
  * What it does: Allows storing of data that was created during the runtime of the application.
  * Justification: This feature was implemented so that data entered by the user during the lifetime of the application would be stored.
  * Highlights: As our team found it troublesome to catch all the corner cases if we were to create a csv file. 
                We used the `Serializable` class in `java` to help us simplify file storage.

#### Enhancements to existing features:
* Separated dependency of parser class from command class by creating Command Parser classes for certain features.
  * These include [SessionCreateCommandParser](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/parser/commandparser/SessionCreateCommandParser.java),
    [SessionDeleteCommandParser](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/parser/commandparser/SessionDeleteCommandParser.java), 
    [SessionEditCommandParser](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/parser/commandparser/SessionEditCommandParser.java) and
    [SessionListCommandParser](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/parser/commandparser/SessionListCommandParser.java) classes.
* [PersonList](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/data/PersonList.java)
  * Implemented a wrapper class for storing a list of Person objects.
* Integration of [`TableFormatter`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/ui/TableFormatter.java) class to
  [`Profile`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/splitlah/data/Profile.java) class
  * Improves the readability when printing list of sessions.
