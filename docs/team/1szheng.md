## Project: PlanITarium

PlanITarium is an application that assists you and your family in managing your finances, optimized for use on the
Command Line Interface (CLI). You can use it to view your monthly financial status, logically group family members for
better management, and categorise your expenditures. PlanITarium is written in, and meant to be run on `Java 11`.

### Summary of Contributions

* **Code
  Contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=T10&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=1szheng&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

<p></p>

* **New Feature**: Added user input parsing.
    * Functionality: The parser methods that retrieves the parameters from the user's input and assists in correcting
      incorrect input format by providing feedback messages and warnings.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user can make mistakes when entering commands.
      The application should provide understandable and descriptive messages to assist in the corrections.
    * Highlights: This feature required an in-depth analysis on the user's possible undesirable inputs and deciding if
      such input should be blocked or given a warning. Its implementation then required much research and testing as
      there exists methods provided by Java that are misleading in its description or usage.

<p></p>

* **New Feature**: Added user input validation.
    * Functionality: The parser methods that helps to ensure that the user's inputs are valid.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product as a user can make mistakes when entering commands. Such methods
      are consolidated in the Parser class for ease of access, modification and addition by developers.
    * Highlights: This feature requires information and cooperation from the various command implementations, and
      affects future implementations in the same manner.

<p></p>

* **New Feature**: Added category enumeration.
    * Functionality: The enumeration of expenditure categories that allow users to tag their expenditures through the
      usage of number labels that are assigned to each category.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product as it allows advanced users to better manage their expenditure by
      categorizing them. Enumeration is used over the alternatives as the application currently does not allow for
      customized categories.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects future commands or features that wish to extend the categorising of
      expenditures.

---

### Add an income: `addin`

> Adds an entry to your list of tracked incomes.

Format: `addin /g GROUP_INDEX /u USER_INDEX /d DESCRIPTION /i INCOME /p <T/(any)>`

* **GROUP_INDEX** refers to the index of the group that you belong to.
* **USER_INDEX** refers to the index of that is tagged to you.
* **DESCRIPTION** refers to the name or description of your income.
* **INCOME** refers to the monetary value of your income.
* **<T/(any)>** refers to whether your income is recurrent on a monthly-basis.

> :information_source: Notes:
> * Each person will have their incomes recorded separately from one another.
> * The income entries will be indexed starting from 1 and **incremented** for every entry.

Example of usage:

* Add a monthly-recurrent Salary of $2,000, to Alice's income.

  `addin /g 1 /u 1 /d Salary /i 2000 /p T`

* _Result_: Entry for Salary is added to Alice's income list with an income index of **1**.

### Delete an income: `deletein`

> Deletes an entry from your list of tracked incomes.

Format: `deletein /g GROUP_INDEX /u USER_INDEX /r INCOME_INDEX`

* **GROUP_INDEX** refers to the index of the group that you belong to.
* **USER_INDEX** refers to the index of that is tagged to you.
* **INCOME_INDEX** refers to the index of the income you would like to delete.

> :information_source: Notes:
> * The income indexes that are higher than the deleted one will be **decremented** after the deletion is completed.
>     * E.g. If index 1 is a target for deletion, index 2 and beyond will be decremented.

Example of usage:

* Delete the monthly-recurrent Salary of $2,000 from Alice's income.

  `deletein /g 1 /u 1 /r 1`

* _Result_: Income entry for Salary of $2,000 is deleted from Alice's income list.

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below shows the high-level design of PlanITarium.

![ArchitectureDiagram](../images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

> :information_source: **Note:** The that `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document
> can be found in the diagrams folder. Refer to the above [PlantUML Tutorial](#acknowledgements)
> to learn how to create and edit these diagrams when necessary.

**Overview of components in the Architecture**

[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/planitarium/PlanITarium.java)
is responsible for,

* At launch, initialize the components in an appropriate manner and calls Storage to read data if any.
* Read user's commands from standard input for command execution.
* At shut down, invokes shutdown sequence and calls Storage to save its current data.

[`UI`](#ui-component) is responsible for the UI of PlanITarium.

[`Commands`](#commands-component) is responsible for the handling and executing of commands.

[`Parser`](#parser-component) is responsible for the parsing and validating of user input.

[`Family`](#family-component) is responsible for holding the user data of PlanITarium in memory.

[`Money`](#money-component) is responsible for holding the monetary information in memory.

[`Storage`](#storage-component) is responsible for reading and writing data to the hard disk.

**How the components interact with each other**

The following Sequence Diagram shows a high-level view on how the components interact when the user enters the command
`add /g 2 /n Alice`. The interactions with storage is not showcased in this section, but is detailed in the
[Data Archiving](#data-archiving) section.

![ArchitectureSequenceDiagram](../images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)
> :information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddPersonCommand` ends at the destroy marker :x:
> but due to the limitations of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

Each of the components are defined and implemented as a class with the same name. The section below provides
more in-depth details on how the components interact with one another.

Each component may consist of several classes that are working seamlessly together to achieve their intended abstracted
representation. For example, the `Money` component contains an abstract class that is extended by `Income` and
`Expenditure` to represent the types of money that can be managed.

### Parser Component

**Class:** [`Parser.java`
](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/planitarium/parser/Parser.java)

The Class Diagram below shows the full structure of the `Parser` component and the components it interacts with.

![ParserClassDiagram](../images/ParserClassDiagram.png)

The `Parser` component consists of the
[`Parser`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/planitarium/parser/Parser.java)
class,
[`ParserUtility`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/planitarium/parser/ParserUtility.java)
class and several `Exception` classes.

The `Parser` class provides the `parseXYZ()` and `getValidXYZ()` methods where `XYZ` is a placeholder for the type of
term (e.g. `parseCommandType()` and `getValidUserIndex`). The methods prepended by **parse** assists in parsing the user
input into its respective terms and the method prepended by **getValid** assists in validating the parsed terms and
returning an appropriately typed object to the `Commands` component. The `Parser` class interacts with the
`ParserUtility` class which provides supporting methods for parsing and validating. Both classes throws exceptions as
required.

How the `Parser` component is used:

1. When the `Commands` component receives a user input, `parseCommandType()` is called upon to parse the type of command
   to be executed.
2. This will result in the keyword of the command to be returned as a string.
3. When necessary, the `parseXYZ()` methods will be called upon to parse more terms for the `Commands`
   component to obtain the details required for the command execution (e.g. `parseGroupIndex("add /n Alice /g 2")`
   to get group 2). The `ParserUtility` assists the parsing during this process by providing utility methods.
4. The `getValidXYZ()` methods will also be called upon thereafter to check and return valid typecasted objects to be
   used for the command execution (e.g. `getValidGroupIndex(indexString)` to check that the index provided corresponds
   to an existing group). The `ParserUtility` is also called here to assist with the validation process.

The following Sequence Diagram shows how the classes of the `Parser` component interacts for each user command.

![ParserOverviewSequenceDiagram](../images/ParserSequenceDiagram0.png)

> :information_source: **Note:** the `warnIfNotSpacedForwardSlash` function is to be updated in future iterations and
> currently does not work for forward slashes in the same format as our delimiters in use.

The following are the range of indexes deemed valid:

| Index       | Range                                                                               |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Group       | [1, ..., 3]                                                                         |
| User        | [1, ..., MAX_UID], where MAX_UID is the number of people in the given group         |
| Category    | [1, ..., 6]                                                                         |
| Income      | [1, ..., MAX_IID], where MAX_IID is the number of income entries for a given person |
| Expenditure | [1, ..., MAX_EID], where MAX_EID is the number of income entries for a given person |
