## Overview
EquipmentManager is a Command Line Interface application to help with keeping track of equipment details (e.g. current user, quantity, cost, warranty duration, purchase date) for an AV club. It provides a clean and fast way to manage the inventory as compared to “traditional” methods such as an Excel spreadsheet.
