## Project: WerkIt!
## Overview

This page showcases my contributions to the development of WerkIt!, an application that I have co-developed with
my peers as part of a team project (tP) in the CS2113T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming module
offered by the School of Computing, National University of Singapore.

### About the Project
WerkIt! is a command line interface (CLI) application written in Java that allows users to create a weekly workout
schedule for them to refer to and follow. More details about the project can be found in the following locations:
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-2/tp)
* [WerkIt! User Guide](../UserGuide.md)
* [WerkIt! Developer Guide](../DeveloperGuide.md)

### Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to search for either exercises, workouts, plans, or everything at one go.
    * **What it does**: Allows the users to search specifically for exercises/workouts/plans/everything. Users are allowed 
to specify the type before they search.
    * **Justification**: This feature improves the usability of WerkIt! significantly. When the users store increasing amount
of exercises/workouts/plans into WerkIt!, it might be hard for them to find their desired data, by using the search
feature, they can easily search for any type of data they want with a keyword.
    * **Highlights**: This enhancement requires a high level of understand of the product as well as a deep understanding
in data structure as different data structures are used in different type of data. For example, exercises
data are stored in array while workouts data make use of both array and hashmap. In order to retrieve the required 
matching results from any type of data, proficiency in data structure is indispensable.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store plan data into local resource file as well as load the file when launching app 
.
  * **What it does**: Allows the users to store their plan data locally such that they can view their plan data without
opening WerkIt!.
  * **Justification**: This feature improves the product and user experience significantly as all the data are backed up
locally. Since every plan is written into resource file immediately after the creation of plan, all the data are secured
in the event that WerkIt! exit unexpectedly. Furthermore, if the users just want to take a look at what plans they have,
they can do that by directly opening the local file instead of launching WerkIt!.
  * **Highlights**: This enhancement affects feature to be implemented in the future as any modification related to plan 
will be reflected in the local plan file. It required a rigorous analysis of product design and strong understand of
logic as it has the ability to store users' customized number of workouts in the plans. That is, the number of workouts in each
plan is not fixed, this enhancement can detect the number of workouts in each plan, then handle and store them
accordingly. Furthermore, in the case of local file corruption, such as when users manually edited the local file, this enhancement is
able to catch the error and take actions against the corrupted plans' data only, without affecting other uncorrupted
plans in the same file.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view help.
  * **What it does**: Allows the users to view all the features with examples.
  * **Justification**: This feature allows the users to have a complete guide on how to use each command with examples.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to populate exercise data from our data file to the product.
  * **What it does**: Prepopulate a list of exercises for the users to construct workouts, plans and schedule.
  * **Justification**: This feature is the core foundation of WerkIt! as the creation of workouts/plans/schedule is
impossible without the preloaded exercises.
* **New Feature**: Added the feature for users to view the exercises available for selection.
  * **What it does**: Allows the users to view all the exercises.
  * **Justification**: Users need to know what exercises can be used to construct their workouts/plans/schedule.
