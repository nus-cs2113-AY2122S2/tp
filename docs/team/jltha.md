## Overview

Sherpass is a command line interface desktop application to help students manage their academic workloads
by preparing them a timetable to plan their activities, as well as encouraging them to 
complete the activities with the use of the study session.

- New Features:

  - Timetable generation (includes parsing of user input to generate the appropriate timetable)
    - What it does: 
      1. Allows the user to view a timetable for the current day/week.
      User is also able to view the timetable for a specific date of his/her choosing.
      Timetable for the day is always shown when the user starts the application.
      2. Allows the user to view all the pending tasks/tasks that have been added
      in a condensed version.
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to view their schedule and any related tasks
    which requires their attention, allowing them to take action promptly.
    - Highlights: This feature affects existing commands (edit/delete) which requires a 
    task number in order to manipulate the task content, or remove that task.
    - Added junit tests to ensure the feature is as bug free as possible.
    
  - Study session (Parsing user inputs and UI)
    - What it does:
      1. Allows the user to enter a study session and complete any tasks that are due.
      2. Allows the user to also select different extra features within the study session, e.g.
      choosing different timer modes, as well as marking and listing tasks.
      3. Shows a pop-up window of the timer once the user has started a timer of his/her choosing.
    - Justification:
      1. The different modes which are parsed from the user input allows the variety of choices, since the 
      study session aims to provide users the tools to maximise his/her productivity in completing any tasks at hand.
      2. The extra pop-up window provides easily accessible timer functions for when the user has started the timer. 
      This removes the need for typing out command words as inputs, which is convenient for when the user is doing 
      time-sensitive tasks. Such a feature resolves the problem of the command not being registered properly as the 
      elapsed time and time left are being printed in the terminal.
    - Credits: The following imports were used to create the pop-up window (GUI) for the timer:
      - javax.swing.JFrame;
      - javax.swing.JLabel;
      - javax.swing.JToggleButton;
      - javax.swing.SwingConstants;
      - java.awt.BorderLayout;
      - java.awt.event.ActionListener;
      - java.awt.event.WindowEvent;
      - java.awt.event.WindowListener;
    - Added crucial junit tests (for parsing of inputs) to ensure the feature is as bug free as possible.
    

- Enhancements to existing features:

  - Refactored the code for add command, edit command, and delete command to incorporate
  both adding/editing/deleting of recurring and non-recurring tasks in the codebase
  (pull requests [#83](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/83), 
  [#150](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/150)).
  - Fixed the parsing of user inputs to be more accurate and flexible. 
  Also used a new algorithm to parse the task description to allow for special characters in the description.
  (pull request [#83](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/83)).
  - Implemented the feature of checking of date and time clashes when adding/editing tasks
  (as the schedules in a timetable should not have such clashes)
  (pull requests [#83](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/83), [#137](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/137)).
  - Clean up the code in various occasions (pull requests [#41](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/41),
    [#64](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/64), [#150](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/150)).

- Project management:
    - Managed releases `v1.0` - `v2.0` (2 releases) on GitHub.
    - Set up the team repo in the beginning.
    - Maintained issue tracker for team repo 
    (Assigned issues with its own labels and closed them whenever the issue is resolved).
    - Enabled assertions and logging for teammates to use.

- Documentation
    - Added a new Jekyll theme to user and developer guide (Cayman theme) - [link](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/tree/master/docs) 
    - User Guide:
      - Added documentation for features `study session` 
      (add timer Ui diagrams and explanations on it), `timetable` and `mark/unmark`. 
      (examples: pull requests [#70](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/70), [#86](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/86))
      - Did some tweaks to existing features in the document `add`, `delete`. Added extra pictures
      (examples: pull requests [#161](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/161))
      for clearer illustration of command usages.
    - Developer Guide:
      - Added implementation details of the `timetable` feature 
      (examples: pull requests [#64](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/64),
      [#139](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/139), [#161](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/161)).
      - Enhanced the architecture diagram of Sherpass. (pull request [#161](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/161))
