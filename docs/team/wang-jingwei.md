## Project - Spendvelope
<hr>
As online shopping becomes more convenient and transactions become easier, people tend to overshoot their budget
because they are not aware of their accumulated expenditure.
Spendvelope is designed to remind the buyer of their preset spending limit and give warnings once the limit 
is exceeded.
