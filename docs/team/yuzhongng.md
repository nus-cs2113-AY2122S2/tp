#### New features:
  - `Timetable` scheduling
    - User would be able to see his timetable for the day, tomorrow, current week, next week,
      current Month, and any specific Month. 

#### Enhancements implemented: 
- Refactor Parser Class
  - Pull Request [#73](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/73)
  - Most of the features implemented will go through the Parser Class such as `Task`, `Timer`,
    `Storage`, `Timetable` and `Main`.  
  - Split the main parser class to several subclass such as `StorageParser`, `TaskParser`, `TimerParser` 
    and `TimetableParser`.
    Each subclass will handle its own parser command.
  
    
    For eg, All the task related command will be passed to TaskParser. Parser Class will be responsible for decoding 
    User Input. The decoded input will be then pass to its relevant Parser Class such as TaskParser for further 
    computation.


- Refactor Timetable Class
  - Pull Request [#77](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/pull/77)
  - Original `Timetable` class is responsible for a lot of things such as, ensuring proper printing of timetable schedule, 
    computation of Timetable Class. 
  - Split the Timetable Class into 3 different subclass, such as `TimetableLogic`, `TimetablePrinting` and `Timetable`. 
  - `TimetableLogic` will be responsible for all the computation of Timetable.
  - `TimetablePrinting` will be responsible for the proper formatting of Timetable schedule.
  - `Timetable` will be responsible for the type of method available for the user.
