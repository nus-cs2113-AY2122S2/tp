### Project: Airline Reservation Check in System (ARCS)
ARCS is a command line application used to help airline staff manage counter transactions. The user interacts with it using a CLI (Command-Line Interface).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**: 
  * Feature: Added commands for managing flight routes, including Add Route Command, Delete Route Command, Find Route Command, and List Route command.
    * What it does: This feature allows the user to manage flight routes. The routes can then be booked by customers.
    * Justification: This feature serves as part of the backbone of the application. It will be frequently used by airline staff.
    * Highlights: This is one of the first few features implemented for the system. It requires a comprehensive analysis and construction of the system architecture.
    Future enhancement follows the same design pattern implemented in this feature.
  * Feature: Added commands for managing customers, including Add Customer Command, Delete Customer Command, Find Customer Command, and List Customer Command.
    * What it does: It allows the user to register customers into the system and manage customers.
    The airline staff must add the customer into the system before the customer can book any flight.
    * Justification: This feature supports many other features, such as making meal reservation and booking flight. 
    It links different features of the system and makes the system cohesive.
    * Highlights: This feature entails analysis and design of the database.
    It requires to design the data objects in a clear and easy to user manner.
  * Feature: Added commands for managing flight bookings, including Book Command, Delete Booking Command, and List Booking Command.
    * What it does: This feature allows the user to book flights for customers and manage existing bookings.
    The user can book fight, delete flight booking and view all flight bookings.
    * Justification: This is one of the most important features of the system, because booking flights for customers is the major duty of a counter staff.
    * Highlights: The implementation of this feature is challenging because it requires interaction of many data objects.
