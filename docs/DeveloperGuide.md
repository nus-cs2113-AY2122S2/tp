## **Design and Implementation**

### Architecture

Our design draws significant inspiration from the implementation of AddressBook Level 3 (henceforth AddressBook). 
As the program was initially conceptualised to be a text-based command-line interface, heavy consideration was given
to the design and user interactions when it came to the text input to be parsed by the user. 
As such, we referenced AddressBook to segment the program into `Parser`, `Command` and `Equipment` classes.

**Main components of the architecture**

- `Duke` is the Main class and entry-point for the program. 
- `Parser` serves as the first filter to split raw text input and pass in arguments to the `Command` for further processing.
- `Command`, together with its various subclasses serve as specific implementations to pass the arguments taken in to the various methods of the `EquipmentManager` class.
- `EquipmentManager` keeps track of actual `Equipment` instances created by our program.
- `Storage` performs File I/O functions.

### Parser

`Parser` is the first filter for text inputs read to the user. It serves to:
1. Split text input from the user into strings of argument pairs.
2. Check and modify upper/lower case for argument tags.
3. Remove backticks, beginning and trailing whitespace.
4. Create the correct instance of `Command` based on the argument tag.

As alluded to prior, one major consideration was to build it in a manner that can parse text input as effectively as possible. In considering text input, we divided the parsing into the following segments:

<!--suppress HtmlDeprecatedAttribute -->
<p align="center"><code>commandWord [argumentType/`argumentValue`] [...]</code></p>

To dispatch <code>argumentType/\`argumentValue\`</code> strings to the correct `Command` class, the following logic is employed by `Parser#parseCommand`.

#### 1. Parse the command word

<p align="center"><code>commandWord</code></p>

`Parser#splitCommandTerm` splits the input string upon the first space. 
The first substring is used to decide which `Command` to dispatch while the second is used for its arguments.
In the case where a second substring is not required, as in the case of `help` and `list`, a null String is used and the following step is skipped entirely.

####2. Split arguments

<p align="center"><code>[argumentType/`argumentValue`] [...]</code></p>

Complex commands such as `add` and `update` necessitate multiple arguments.
To implement this while ensuring that multi-word strings are acceptable input, `extractArguments` is implemented.

The main regular expression ([details here](https://regex101.com/r/dMwMWw/3)) sought to match `argumentType` and <code>argumentValue</code> pairs with a positive lookahead. 
The final argument pair will then be extracted using a separate regex. 
Together, this ensured that all argument pairs can be effectively parsed and dispatched to each `Command` class.

<details><summary><b>Special <code>delete</code> implementation</b></summary>
<p>

For added safeguards in equipment deletion, the delete command implements a more stringent regex to match one argument pair of <code>s/\`SERIAL_NUMBER\`</code>.  

</p>
</details>

Throughout the `Parser` implementation, exceptions were caught to return `IncorrectCommand` classes that can be used to pass error messages to the user. These will be discussed in the following segments.

### Command classes

`Command` classes are largely similar to each other. Taking in input Strings from `Parser`, they invoke methods from `EquipmentManager` to perform the necessary actions. Where applicable, the `Command` classes also convert values to the necessary data types (Double, EquipmentType and LocalDate) prior to passing these values in.

The most complex command, `UpdateCommand` will be explained here as the method calls are similar to the remaining commands. The update feature is facilitated by `UpdateCommand`. It extends `ModificationCommand` and implements the following operations:

* `UpdateCommand#generateUpdatePairs()` — Generates pairs of attributes and their update values.
* `UpdateCommand#generateUpdateString()` — Generates String with details of the update executed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the update feature behaves at each step.

#### Step 1 
The user adds an equipment to the system with the help of the `add` command. The added equipment has the following attributes shown below.

![equipment0](images/equipment0.png)

![sequenceDiagram1](images/sequenceDiagram1.png)

#### Step 2
The user executes `update s/S1404115ASF n/SpeakerC c/2000 pd/2022-01-29` to update equipment with serial number S1404115ASF. `Parser#parseCommand` is called from `Duke` to parse the user's input.

#### Step 3
The parser recognises that an `UpdateCommand` is required, and the UpdateCommand is prepared to return to `Duke`. In the constructor of `UpdateCommand`, `UpdateCommand#prepareModification` is called to set the values of the attributes to be updated. The other attributes are set to null by default.

![sequenceDiagramExecute](images/sequenceDiagramExecute.png)

#### Step 4
`UpdateCommand#execute` is run to process the update. If the serialNumber attribute is null, a `CommandResult` with a `MISSING_SERIAL_NUMBER` output string will be returned. Otherwise, `EquipmentManager#updateEquipment` is called.

#### Step 5
If the update was successful, a `CommandResult` with success message will be returned, else a `CommandResult` with `UPDATE_FAILURE_MESSAGE` will be returned. Upon successful update, the object should be updated with the new attributes as shown in the diagram below.

![equipment1](images/equipment1.png)

#### Step 6
It is not shown in the sequence diagram but ultimately when the CommandResult is returned to `Duke`, the output of the `CommandResult` gets printed out and displayed to the user.

### EquipmentManager

The `EquipmentManager`, as the name suggests, manages all the equipment that the user has.
When initialised, it creates a HashMap called `equipmentList` which is used to save the equipment with their serial numbers as their keys.
The `EquipmentManager` has several methods which allow manipulation to said HashMap such as `addEquipment`, `checkEquipment`, `listEquipment`, `updateEquipment`, and `deleteEquipment`.
These methods are used during the execution of each of the `Command` class.
* `addEquipment` — Adds an `Equipment` to the `equipmentList`.
* `checkEquipment` — Returns the `Equipment` in `equipmentList` that has the given `itemName`.
* `listEquipment` — Returns an ArrayList of all the `Equipment` in `equipmentList`.
* `updateEquipment` — Updates the specified `Equipment` with the corresponding updates given in the ArrayList of pairs.
* `deleteEquipment` — Deletes the specified `Equipment`.

The `EquipmentManager` is implemented as the main storage unit of all `Equipment` during the execution of the program.

### Storage

The `Storage` class is used to store the data of the program. It utilises the Gson library to serialise and deserialise the data.
There is also a LocalDateAdapter class which is used to convert the LocalDate objects to YYYY-MM-DD format.

#### 1. `saveData` method

The `saveData` method is used to save the Equipments added to the `equipment.json` file.
The method will automatically create the file if it does not exist.
While saving the data, the `Equipment` objects in `equipmentList` is converted to a JSON string and saved to the file.
During the execution of the program, the `equipment.json` file will be updated with the latest data after every 5 commands.
Alternatively, the user can manually save the data by calling the `save` command.

#### 2. `loadData` method

The `loadData` method is used to load the data from the `equipment.json` file.
The method is able to handle the cases where:

* The file does not exist.
* The file is empty.
* The data in the file is not in the correct format.
* There are more than one `Equipment` object with the same serial number.

While loading the data, the `equipment.json` file is read and the data is converted from a JSON string to an ArrayList of `Equipment` objects.
The ArrayList of `Equipment` objects is then added to the `equipmentList` HashMap.

The `Storage` class is used in the `Duke` class. 
It is used to save and load the data of the program.
Below are the procedures of the `Storage` class usage during program execution.

1. `Duke` is initialised.
2. `Storage` is initialised.
3. `Storage#loadData` is called to load the data from the `equipment.json` file.
4. After every 5 commands, `Storage#saveData` is called to save the data to the `equipment.json` file.
5. Lastly, before the program terminates, `Storage#saveData` is called to save the data to the `equipment.json` file.

## Product scope
### Target user profile

The target user is the logistics chief of an event support club. He is responsible for the logistics of the club and the equipment that is used during events. 

### Value proposition

Equipment for the club differ in terms of shape and size. Owing to the climate-sensitive and fragile nature of some of these equipment, they are often stored in opaque containers, which may not be easily accessible or quickly identifiable given space constraints. By keeping records of this information on our application, the logistics chief can easily access and retrieve this information without having to make a physical trip down to the storeroom.

Further, maintaining a record of the equipment is a time-consuming task given that they often need to be referred to by both the serial number and a common name (short alias) used by club members. As the post of logistics chief is changed every year when passed down to a new member, this member will need to be acquainted with both the common name and the serial number of the relevant equipment. Our application thus provides a convenient way to search by both specifications. In fact, additional information such as the vendor, purchased date, equipment type, and the cost of the equipment is also stored and searchable.
