### Test Case 1

New employees can enter `packages` to view all available packages by the agency.

Additionally, they can enter `info {package number}` to view more in-depth information about the package.

Employees can also input new reservations using `reserve {package_number},{contact_name},{contact_number},{number_pax}`

They can then view and verify reservations for that package using `reservation {package_number}`

## Feature - Help Command 
Aim: Displays a list of all available commands that the user can refer to as a guide

## Feature - Storage
#### Initialisation (Loading Data)
The sequence diagram that shows how `Storage` is created and the data is loaded from the saved files when the program is initialised is shown below:
![](LoadFileSeqDiag.png)

1. `TARBS` creates a Storage object with the relevant file name (`filePath`).
2. `TARBS` then calls the `createPackages()` method of the Storage class
3. `storage` will call the `parseSavedFile()` method, which initiates a while loop that iterates through the text file and processes the string data using the respective `parse` methods.
4. A new `TravelPackage` object is constructed with the relevant data.
5. A new `Packages` object is created using the `TravelPackage` object and returned back to `TARBS`.

#### Saving data
The sequence diagram that shows how `Storage` is used to save the current list of travel packages and reservations is shown below: </br>

![](SaveFilesSeqDiag.png)

1. `TARBS` calls the `savePackageToFile()` method of `storage`, passing in the `packages` object.
2. `storage` will then use a loop to iteratively retrieve the data in string format from the individual `TravelPackage` objects.
3. `storage` will create a new `FileWriter` object to write the string data into a text file.

## Feature - Parser
The sequence diagram shows an example of how a user input is parsed and returns a new `Command`.

For simplicity, `ByeCommand` is shown here:
