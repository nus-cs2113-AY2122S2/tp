## 5. Design

The following architecture diagram provides a high level overview of the main components of Mod Happy and how they interact with one another.

![Class Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/ClassDiagrams/Components.puml)

The `Main` class is responsible for handling program initialisation, termination, as well as the application's main execution logic.

Mod Happy's components are summarised below:

* `UI`: Manages the application's text UI.
* `Parser`: Interprets user input and returns corresponding `Command` objects.
* `Command`: Handles command execution logic.
* `Data`: Manages module and task data in program memory.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to Mod Happy's data storage files.

<br>

### 5.1. UI Component

The `TextUi` class serves strictly as intermediary between the user and the program, and does not directly interact with any components other than the `Main` class. It fulfils the following roles:

- Listens for and grabs the user's input using a `Scanner`, and returns it to `Main` as a string for further processing.
- Displays any command results or status and error messages to the user.

<br>

### 5.2. Parser Component

![Class Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/ClassDiagrams/Parser.puml)

The `Parser` component serves to interpret user input and construct the relevant `Command` objects to be returned to `Main` for execution later on. This component comprises the following classes:

* `Parser`, which is an abstract class serving as the parent of all other classes in this component. This class implements basic parsing functionality through the use of regular expressions and the built-in `Pattern` class. This functionality is modified by its child classes to suit their own purposes.
* `ModHappyParser`, which identifies the command word present in the user input and invokes the relevant command-specific parser.
* A variety of command-specific parsers (e.g. `AddParser` for the `add` command), referred to in this guide as `XYZParser` for simplicity. These classes perform further parsing on any command-specific arguments, constructing and returning the corresponding `XYZCommand` object.

> ðŸ“” <span style="color:#3333ff">**NOTE:**</span>
> 
> `NoArgumentParser` is an exception to the above; instead of being associated with a single command type, it is responsible for handling all commands which do not accept any arguments.

The following details how the `Parser` component works at runtime:

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/ParserSequenceDiagram.puml)

1. A single `ModHappyParser` instance is initialised by `Main` during at the start of the program.
2. Each time the user inputs a command, `ModHappyParser`'s `parseCommand()` method with the input as the parameter.
3. `ModHappyParser` identifies the relevant command-specific parser `XYZParser` and passes on the remaining unparsed arguments to its `parseCommand()` method.
4. `XYZParser` parses the command arguments subsequently, and finally construct an `XYZCommand` instance, which is subsequently returned to `Main`.

<br>

### 5.3. Data Component

The `Data` component is responsible for the storage and manipulation of tasks and modules as well as their associated attributes in program memory.

The following partial class diagram illustrates the structure of this component.

![Class Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/ClassDiagrams/Data.puml)

The `ModuleList` class serves as the main data storage class for the program, and is always instantiated when the program is started. It holds:
* A `Module` object representing the General Tasks list. This `Module` is instantiated upon `ModuleList`'s creation and is meant to be the "default" module for all uncategorised or miscellaneous tasks.
* An `ArrayList` containing all user-created modules.

The `Module` class serves as a wrapper around a `TaskList`, providing additional attributes including the module code and module description. Within the context of Mod Happy, modules can be viewed as task categories with names, descriptions and other attributes; for this reason, the General Tasks list is implemented as a `Module` under the hood.

> ðŸ“” <span style="color:#3333ff">**NOTE:**</span>
>
> An alternative method of implementing `ModuleList` is shown below, where the default General Tasks
list is simply represented as a `TaskList` instead of a full-fledged `Module`.
>
> ![Class Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/ClassDiagrams/DataAlternative.puml)
>
> While this model is arguably closer to real life, the program logic would have to operate on different object types depending on whether a given `Task` belongs to a user-created Module, or the default General Tasks list. This was deemed to increase coupling and introduce too much unnecessary clutter to the code, hence it was not used.

<br>

### 5.4. Command Component

The `Command` component is in charge of actually executing the operations requested by the user.

The following partial class diagram illustrates the structure of this component:

![Class Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/ClassDiagrams/CommandClassDiagram.puml)

All commands inherit the abstract `Command` class and must contain an `execute()` method. The program logic that must be executed to fulfil the requested command is implemented in this method. Additionally, `execute()` returns any command output to be displayed to the user as feedback.

`Command` instances are generated by their corresponding `Parser` classes (e.g. `AddCommand` is constructed by `AddParser`) and executed by `Main`.

<br>

### 5.5. Storage Component

The `Storage` component is responsible for the saving and loading of program data to and from its data files. The following class diagram illustrates the structure of this component:

![Class Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/ClassDiagrams/Storage.puml)

* `Storage` is an interface supporting the reading and writing of data to a file.
* `Storage` is implemented by `JsonStorage`, an abstract class that reads and writes objects to a file in JSON format.
* `ListStorage` is an abstract class inheriting from `JsonStorage`, which is specifically used for the serialisation and deserialisation of `ArrayList` instances. `ModuleListStorage` and `TaskListStorage` both inherit from `ListStorage`.

## 6. Implementation

This section describes some details on how some features are implemented.

<br>

### 6.1. Edit Feature

The edit feature allows the user to change a parameter of a task/module. The parameters of a module is its module description while the parameters of a task are its task name, task description and estimated working time. 

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/EditSeqDiagrams/Edit.puml)

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/EditSeqDiagrams/GetModule.puml)

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/EditSeqDiagrams/GetTask.puml)

Here is an example of editing the description of a task (First task of the module CS2113T):

1. User inputs `edit task 1 -m CS2113T -d "Changed"`.
2. `ModHappyParser` identifies the command word as `edit` and invokes `EditParser.getParser()`.
3. `EditParser.getParser()` will identify `task` and returns `EditTaskParser`
4. `ModHappyParser` passes `task 1 -m CS2113T -d "Changed"` to `EditTaskParser`.
5. `EditTaskParser` instantiates a `EditCommand` with `taskModule = "CS2113T"`, `taskIndex = 0`, `description = "Changed"`, `workingTime = null`, `taskname = null`. This is returned to `Main`.
6. `Main` calls the `execute()` method of the `EditCommand` instance.
7. `EditCommand` first gets the relevant `Module` and invokes `editTaskFromModule(targetModule)`.
8. `editTaskFromModule(targetModule)` retrieves the task `targetTask` specified by the index and invokes `targetTask.setTaskDescription(description)` to change the description.

<br>

### 6.2. Tag Feature

The tag feature allows the user to add user-created one-word tags to each task, so that tasks can be filtered for easily. Each task stores its tags in an `ArrayList<String>`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/TagSeqDiagrams/Tag.puml)

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/TagSeqDiagrams/GetModule.puml)

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/TagSeqDiagrams/CheckAndRunTagOperation.puml)

Here is an example on adding a tag to a general task:  

1. User inputs `tag add 2 testTag`.
2. `ModHappyParser` identifies the command word as `tag` and passes `add 2 "testTag"` to `TagParser`.
3. `TagParser` instantiates a `TagCommand` with `tagOperation = "add"`, `taskIndex = 2`, `tagDescription = "testTag"` and `taskModule = null`. This is returned to `Main`.
4. `Main` calls the `execute()` method of the `TagCommand` instance.
5. `TagCommand` first gets the relevant `Module`. Since `taskModule` is null, `getGeneralTasks()` is called and the General Tasks `Module` is retrieved.
6. Next, `TagCommand` checks the `tagOperation`. As its value is `add`, `addTag(targetModule)` is called.
7. Finally, command feedback is returned to `Main`, indicating that the operation was successful.

<br>

### 6.3. Grade Feature

The grade feature allows the user to input their predicted/actual grade, according to the official grades that NUS supports.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/Grade.puml)

Here is an example on how to assign a grade to a module:

1. User inputs `grade CS2113T A+`
2. `ModHappyParser` identifies the command word as `grade` and passes `CS2113T A+` to `GradeParser`.
3. `GradeParser` instantiates a `GradeCommand` with `moduleCode = "CS2113T"`, `moduleGrade = "A+"`. This is returned to `Main`.
4. `Main` calls the `execute()` method of the `GradeCommand` instance.
5. `execute()` retrieves the `Module` instance of `CS2113T` if it exists and invokes `addGradeToModule(m)`.
6. `addGradeToModule(m)` then invokes `m.setModuleGrade(moduleGrade)` to assign the input grade to the specified module.

<br>

### 6.4. GPA Feature

The GPA feature computes the user's GPA to 2 decimal places, based on the inputted grades and modular credits of each module currently stored in the program.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the process:

![Sequence Diagram](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/proxy?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/master/docs/SequenceDiagrams/GPA.puml)

Here is an example on how to calculate GPA:

1. User inputs `gpa`.
2. `ModHappyParser` identifies the command word as `gpa`. Since `gpa` takes no arguments, `gpa` is passed to `NoArgumentParser`.
3. `NoArgumentParser` returns an instance of `GpaCommand` to `Main`.
4. `Main` calls the `execute()` method of the `GpaCommand` instance.
5. `execute()` invokes `calculateGpa()`, which performs the actual GPA computation by iterating through the provided `moduleList`.
6. After calculating the GPA, a command feedback string is generated and returned as a string.

<br>

### 6.5. Storage Feature

This component makes use of the [Gson](https://sites.google.com/site/gson/gson-user-guide) library, which can be used to convert Java Objects to and from their JSON representation.

Several type-specific classes exist, each overseeing the storage of a different type of user data:

* `ConfigurationStorage` handles the saving and loading of user preferences. This data is stored in the `data/configuration.json` file.
* `TaskListStorage` handles the saving and loading of the General Tasks list as an `ArrayList<Task>` instance. This data is stored in the `data/tasks.json` file.
* `ModuleListStorage` handles the saving and loading of all user-created modules as well as the tasks associated with them as an `ArrayList<Module>` instance. This data is stored in the `data/modules.json` file.
* `ModHappyStorageManager` keeps a reference of storage and provides other components with easy and encapsulated access to write and load all kinds of data in Mod Happy. 

It is worth noting that `ModuleListStorage` and `TaskListStorage` are implemented separately despite having mostly similar code, as the `gson.fromJson` method takes in the class of the object to be constructed, and `.class` cannot be used with generic types.

After data is loaded from the data file, some verification checks are performed to ensure that the data is valid. The following table details some actions taken by Mod Happy in response to various types of data errors:

| Type of error                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Action taken                                                              |

| Module's `moduleGrade` attribute is missing or contains illegal value                                                                                                                                                       | The `moduleGrade` is set to `NOT_ENTERED` (the default value when unset). |
| Task's `isTaskDone` attribute is missing or contains illegal value                                                                                                                                                          | The missing value is initialised to `false`.                              |
| Task's `taskDuration` attribute is missing or contains illegal value                                                                                                                                                        | The `taskDuration` is set to `null` (the default value when unset).       |
