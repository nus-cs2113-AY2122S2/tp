## Introduction

Airline Check-in and Reservation System(ARCS) aims to provide a dynamic and concise interface for staff to create, view
and cancel flight routes and bookings, create in-flight meal reservations and add Menu Items.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Down the latest version of `ARCS` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122s2-CS2113-F12-3/tp/releases/tag/v2.1b).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your ARCS.
4. Open your command line interface and go to the folder directory.
5. Run the command java -jar CS2113-F12-3.ARCS.jar.
6. Type the command in the command line and press Enter to execute it. <br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`listRoute`** : Lists all existing flight routes.

    * **`addMenuItem`**`addMenuItem name/chocolate_cake type/dessert price/4.50
      ` : Adds a Menu Item named `chocolate cake` to the in-flight menu.

    * **`deleteMenuItem 3`** : Deletes the 3rd menu item shown in the current list.

    * **`findMenuItemName`** `findMenuItemName coke` : Returns all in-flight menu item that contains the word coke. 

    * **`bye`** : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.


## Features
**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addMenuItem name/MENU_ITEM_NAME`, `MENU_ITEM_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add name/chocolate cake`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `findRoute fd/FLIGHT_DATE d/DESTINATION s/SOURCE [ ft/FLIGHT_TIME ]` can be used as `findRoute fd/07112029 d/India s/singapore` or as `findRoute fd/02172022 d/singapore s/china ft/15:30`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `addMenuItem name/MENU_ITEM_NAME type/MENU_ITEM_TYPE`, `type/MENU_ITEM_TYPE addMenuItem name/MENU_ITEM_NAME` is also acceptable.

* Redundant words in the command are ignored.<br>
e.g. in `findRoute fd/01232011 d/Singapore s/US c/120`, `c/120` is ignored since this field is not required.
