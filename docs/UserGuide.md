## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?
- **A**: You may simply copy the `data` folder to the other computer.

**Q**: Hmm, the data does not seem to be saved correctly!
- **A**: Note that this application is *transaction-based*. This means that any changes to the data
will not be saved unless the application is exited gracefully. Any other means of abruptly exiting the programme (such as Ctrl+C)
will not save the data (because they are not taken to be typical exit commands, but rather interrupts).
