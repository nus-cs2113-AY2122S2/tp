# User Guide

## Introduction

CSProj Planner is a desktop app to help Computer Science students manage their projects. However, while being optimized for CS students, the app will still be useful to any student looking to easily keep track of all their upcoming projects. Users are able to add and delete projects at will, as well as view the tasks needed to be done for their submissions.

## Quick Start

- Ensure you have Java  `11` or above installed in your computer.
- Ensure you have downloaded our latest version.
- Copy the file to your preferred folder as the home folder for your CSProj Planner.
- Double-click the file to start the app.
- Type your command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. Some example commands you can try:
   - `addproject cs2113`: Add a new project named cs2113 to the planner.
   - `listproject`: list out all projects in the list.  
   - `exit`: Exits the project.
- The data will be automatically saved after the program exited safely.


## Features 

### Add a project: ```addproject```
Add a project to your current list of projects

Format: `addproject [project_name]`
*The `project_name` can be of any length, number of words, and any types of characters.  
*The `project_name` cannot be pure whitespace.


#### Example of usage
```
addproject project1
```

#### Example of output
```
project1 added.
```

---
### Delete a project: `deleteproject`
Delete a project from your current list of projects

Format: `deleteproject [project_name]`
*The `project_name` must be a match for a current project already in your list of projects

*Note: deleteproject does not use project_index. This is to ensure you are much less likely to mistype and delete the wrong project. It's easier to type the wrong index than the wrong project name.

#### Example of usage
```
deleteproject project1
```

#### Example of output
```
project1 deleted.
```

---
### Print all projects: `listprojects`
Prints all projects in the list with their names and project deadlines

Format: `listprojects` or `listproject`

* The `listprojects`(`listproject`) cannot contain a space, i.e., `list projects`(`list project`) will be considered an unknown command.
* Note that these two commands will lead to the **same** output. The reason why we set 2 command for one function is that we consider some users might forget to print s when they use this command.

#### Example of usage
```
listprojects
```

#### Example of output
```
Here are all current project(s) in your list:
[1] cs2113 (17/03/2022)
```
---
### Add todo to a project: `todo`
Adds a todo task with description to a project

Format: `todo [project_index] [description]`
* The `project_index` must be a positive integer.

#### Example of usage
```
todo 1 buy textbooks
```

#### Example of output
```
Todo:  buy textbooks have been added to project pro1
```

---
### Mark todo as done: `mark`

Format: `mark [project_index] [todo_index]`
* The `project_index` and `todo_index` must be positive integers.

#### Example of usage
```
mark 1 1
```

#### Example of output
```
Todo has been marked as done successfully: 
[X] buy textbooks
```
---
### Set the deadline to a project: `projdeadline`
Adds a deadline date to a project

Format: `projdeadline [project_index] [deadline]`
* The `project_index` must be a positive integer.
* deadline must be entered in the following format "yyyy-mm-dd"
* Alternatively, entering a day of the week also works (i.e. Thursday)

#### Example of usage  
```
projdeadline 1 2022-04-03
```

#### Example of output  
```
Deadline added to project1: 2022-04-03
```
---
### Change the GitHub repo of a project: `changegit`
Changes the GitHub repository link for your project

Format: `changegit [project_index] [github_URL]`
* The `project_index` must be a positive integer.
* Every project comes with the default github repo "http://github.com"
* When entering your github_URL, it must begin with either http:// or https://

#### Example of usage
```
changegit 1 http://github.com/project1
```

#### Example of output
```
The Github Repo for project1 has been changed to: http://github.com/project1
```

---
### Open the GitHub repo of a project: `opengit`
Opens the GitHub repository in your default browser

Format: `opengit [project_index]`

#### Example of usage

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: Copy the data file named `projectList.txt` through `your working directory/src/data/`, then send it to another computer.

If you want to use this data on another computer, please follow any of the below options:
- Option 1: You can firstly download your data and save the file as `projectList.txt`. Then create 2 new folders `src/data` under the directory where you prefer to work. You will be able to see your data when you start the app.
- Option 2: You can first start the app on another computer. You will see the new folder generated under your working directory after the program exits. Replace the `projectList` file with the file you want to transfer under the path `./src/data/`.

Please note that the file name should not be changed.
