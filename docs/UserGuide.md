<span class="box warning">:warning: If your operating system is not listed in the table above, it means our application has 
not been tested on it, and we cannot guarantee that the application will work as intended. We highly encourage you to 
use one of the recommended operating systems listed in the table above. 
We apologise for any inconvenience caused.</span>

<span class="box warning">:warning: (For Microsoft Windows users) In order for the application to display colours properly
on your screen, Windows Terminal needs to be used. The default Command Prompt and Powershell consoles will not be able
to display WerkIt!'s coloured texts properly, so it might show some weird symbols. See [this FAQ](#1-my-terminal-in-windows-is-displaying-weird-symbols-when-i-run-the-application) for more details.</span>

## Features 
In this section, features of the application can be classified into 4 main categories. They are: <br>
* [Exercise and Workout Features](#exercise-and-workout-features)
* [Plan Features](#plan-features) 
* [Schedule Features](#schedule-features)
* [Search Features](#search-features)

Each feature is being run by a specific command format. When the command format is matched, 
the command will then be processed by the application and produce the intended outcome. The format of the commands
contains two types of formatting.

| Format           | Parameters                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `<condition>`    | Contents enclosed between "<>" are the inputs needed for the command to be valid. <br /> Not all commands needs input.          |
| `/commandAction` | Content after "/" is to classify the action of the command. <br/> Such as classifying it to be list / delete / update commands. |

<span class="box warning">:warning: **Heads Up!** Your inputs cannot contain the pipe character `|`!</span>

The following diagram gives you the general procedure on how to create your workout schedule:

want to have multiple plans, you can simply create a new plan using the `plan /new` command to include all the workouts
stated in those plans.

## WerkIt!'s Local Storage Information
When you start WerkIt! for the first time, the following directory and files are created:

```
werkItResources/        // Primary resource directory for WerkIt!
    ├── exercises.txt   // Text file containing a list of exercises
    ├── workouts.txt    // Text file containing a list of user-created workouts
    ├── plans.txt       // Text file containing a list of user-created plans
    └── schedule.txt    // Text file containing a 7-day schedule of user-assigned plans for each day
werkItLogs/
    └── logs.log        // Log file containing logs created by the application
```

Do note that the directory (and by extension, the files) will be created in your terminal's
**current working directory**. Thus, it is highly recommended for you to create a new directory
with the WerkIt! JAR file inside it, and run the application from the directory.

When you launch WerkIt! in subsequent sessions, please ensure that you run it from the same directory
that you did when starting WerkIt! for the first time.

<span class="box warning">:warning: **Important:** Please **do not** directly modify these files on your own as it will lead
to instabilities in the application and possible loss of your data.</span>

Do make regular backups of the `werkItResources` directory. In the event of data loss, please replace the
`werkItResources` directory with your most recent backup copy. In the worst case scenario (i.e. if you don't have a 
proper backup copy), delete the `werkItResources` directory and restart WerkIt! to recreate the directory and files from 
fresh.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. My terminal in Windows is displaying weird symbols when I run the application.

**Example of weird symbols:**<br/>
![Weird Symbols (First Time Run)](images/weirdSymbols-firstTimeRun.png) <br/><br/>
![Weird Symbols (Help Command)](images/weirdSymbols-helpCommand.png)

**A**: Please ensure that you are running the application using **Windows Terminal**, as mentioned in
the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start-guide). If you have not installed it, [click here][1] to install it via the
Microsoft Store.

<span class="box info">:memo: **Why are these symbols appearing?** Without being too technical, these symbols are appearing 
because the terminal you are using is unable to process a particular encoding scheme (i.e. ANSI escape codes). 
These symbols you see are actually colour codes to colour certain texts on the terminal. Terminals that can properly 
read these codes will not show you these symbols and instead show you something like this:<br/><br/>
![No Weird Symbols](images/noWeirdSymbols.png) <br/><br/>
On Windows, the default terminals are unable to process these codes, but Windows Terminal is able to. </span>

### 2. How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Locate your `werkItResources` directory and WerkIt! JAR file, copy and paste it in your other 
computer's desired location. Thereafter, you can run WerkIt! as per normal. 
(Please see [WerkIt's Local Storage Information](#werkits-local-storage-information) for recommended location).

### 3. I cannot see the workouts that I have created in previous sessions.

**A**: Please ensure that you launch WerkIt! from the same directory that you did when starting the application for the 
first time. Your saved data should be in that directory.

### 4. I keep getting file loading errors whenever I start WerkIt!

**A**: It is possible that your local file data is corrupted. If you have a backup copy of the `werkItResources`
directory, replace your existing `werkItResources` directory with the backup copy. Otherwise, you will need to
reset your local file data by deleting the `werkItResources` directory and starting up WerkIt! to recreate the
necessary files in their default numberings.

Do note that these suggestions will lead to a **loss of your saved application data** and you may need to re-enter the 
lost data.
