# SplitLah
SplitLah is a desktop application with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for **splitting bills** amongst you and your friends after a group outing.
Each group outing can consist of several activities with **different people paying the bill** for each activity.
SplitLah does the work of **calculating how much each participant owes** and who they must pay at the end of the outing.


SplitLah also **consolidates all debts intelligently** so that they can be paid off with the fewest number of transactions 
possible, helping you **reduce time spent on making unnecessary transactions**. 
SplitLah remembers your information by saving your outings and activities so that you can **look up past activities** anytime you want.
If you can type fast, SplitLah can manage your outings faster than applications using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

### Who SplitLah is for:
- People who go on group outings often and need to split bills.
- People who go on group outings where different people pay for different activities, making bill-splitting harder.
- People who dislike manually calculating how much everyone owes across several activities.
- People who want to manage outings with multiple social circles in one application.

## How to use this user guide
- Each feature that SplitLah supports is known as a command.
- These commands are divided into five sections: [Session Management](#session-management), [Activity Management](#activity-management), 
[Transaction Management](#transaction-management), [Group Management](#group-management) and [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous).
- Each command has its own section in this guide explaining them in greater detail.
- The format for each command is enclosed within a `code block`, so that they can be copied directly into SplitLah if needed.
  - Example: `help`
- In each command: 
  - The blocks indicated with 💡 are important things to take note of when using the command.
  - The blocks indicated with ⚠️are warnings that you should pay attention to when using the command.

## Quick Notes
- Allowed characters for values:
  - Names of `Sessions`,`Activities` and `Groups` can have all printable [ASCII](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) characters.
  - Names of participants can only contain: `A-Z`, `a-z`
  - Decimals (up to 2 decimal places): `3.5`, `3.95`
  - Unique identifiers must be positive integers less than or equal to `2147483647`: `1`, `3`
  - Dates (DD-MM-YYYY or today): `02-04-2022`, `today`
- A forward slash `/` indicates a delimiter and is used to separate commands into parts.
  Each command's documentation specifies the required delimiters and their purpose.
  - Example: `/n`, `/sid`
  - Therefore, the forward slash `/` should **only** be used to indicate the delimiters,
    and **never** in the arguments.
- Parameters enclosed in `[ ]` must be supplied by the user.
  - Example: `[SESSION_ID]`
- Parameters with an ellipsis `...` indicate that the user can supply multiple values.
  - Example: `[COST1 COST2 ...]`
- Parameters enclosed within `[<` and `>]` indicates that the arguments are optional.
  - Example: `[</gst [GST_PERCENTAGE]>] [</sc [SERVICE_CHARGE]>]`
- Parameters enclosed within `{` and `}` indicates that at least one of the delimiters
  and their respective arguments have to be supplied.
  - Example: `{/pl [NAME1 NAME2 ...] /gid [GROUD_ID]}`

## Warnings
- If the save file cannot be created, **nothing will be saved** during the runtime of SplitLah.
- The save file is **not meant to be read or edited**.
  - If the save file is edited, the application will not be able to load the corrupted save file.
  - A corrupted save file will then be replaced with a new save file upon running SplitLah,
    **all previously saved information will be lost**.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest .jar version of SplitLah from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113T-T10-1/tp/releases)
3. Copy the file to the folder you wish to use as a home folder for SplitLah.
4. Open a terminal and set the working directory to the home folder.
5. Start SplitLah by executing `java -jar splitlah.jar` in the terminal.
6. Type in a command and press Enter to execute it.
7. Refer to [Features](#features) for a more in-depth explanation of all commands available.

## How SplitLah works
* An activity represents a single group activity, paid for by one person. It stores a list of its participants,
  the payer and how much each participant owes.
  * Example: `Lunch at a restaurant`
  * Consisting of the following participants:
    * `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`
  * Paid for by:
    * `Alice`
* A session represents a period of time and stores one or more activities, as well as a list of participants. Each
  activity could have a different payer.
  * Example: `Bob's birthday`
  * Consisting of the following participants:
    * `Alice`, `Bob`, `Charlie`
  * Consisting of the following activities:
    * `Breakfast at McDonald's`, `Lunch at a restaurant`, `Movie at a theatre`
    * Each paid for by a different person.
* At the end of a session, SplitLah calculates how much each person owes and who they need to pay. This information is
  displayed in an easy-to-read summary.

>    and not shrink. This is to prevent introducing any inconsistencies to activities in the session.
>  * Example 1: If the session with session unique identifier of 1 has been created with Alice and Bob 
>    and you wish to edit it to include Charlie, a valid edit command would be: <br>
>    `session /edit /sid 1 /pl Alice Bob Charlie`.
>  * Example 2: If the session with session unique identifier of 1 has been created with
>    Alice and a group consisting of Bob and Charlie, and you wish to edit it to include Mike,
>    a valid edit command would be: <br>
>    `session /edit /sid 1 /pl Alice Bob Charlie Mike`.

>* The names in `[PAYER]` and `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` must also be associated with the session referenced by
>  `[SESSION_ID]`.
>* The names in `[PAYER]` and `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` must only be a single word without whitespaces.
>  * Example: `Alice Tan` is not allowed.
>* The values in `[TOTAL_COST]` and `[COST1 COST2 ...]` are decimal values with a maximum of 12 digits before

### Viewing an activity: `activity /view`
Displays the details about an activity so that you can review it.<br>

> Format: `activity /view /sid [SESSION_ID] /aid [ACTIVITY_ID]`
>
>* `[SESSION_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the session.
>    * The unique identifier for a session can be retrieved with the [`session /list`](#listing-all-sessions-session-list) command.
>* `[ACTIVITY_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the activity. 
>    * The unique identifier for an activity can be retrieved with the [`activity /list`](#listing-all-activities-in-a-session-activity-list) command.

<br>

> **💡 Note:**
>- A session with a unique identifier of `[SESSION_ID]` has to exist before an activity in that session can be viewed.
>- An activity with a unique identifier of `[ACTIVITY_ID]` has to exist before it can be viewed.
>- All values displayed are rounded off to 2 decimal places. This may result in slight inaccuracies.

<br>

**Example**
- Views an activity with a unique identifier of _1_ in a session with a session unique identifier of _1_.<br><br>

## _Transaction Management_

<hr>

### Settling all transactions for a session: `session /summary`

Displays a transaction summary for a session. The transaction summary helps you calculate how much each person in the session
must pay and to whom they should pay for all debts to be resolved.<br>

> Format: `session /summary /sid [SESSION_ID]`
> * `[SESSION_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the session.
>    * The unique identifier for a session can be retrieved with the [`session /list`](#listing-all-sessions-session-list) command.

<br>

> **💡 Notes:**
>* A session with a unique identifier of `[SESSION_ID]` has to exist before its summary can be generated.
>* All values displayed are rounded off to 2 decimal places. This may result in slight inaccuracies.
>* SplitLah simplifies transactions to minimise the number of transactions you have to make.
>  * Example: In the same session, _Alice_ paid for _Bob_'s lunch which costs $10 and _Bob_ paid for _Charlie_'s
>    movie ticket which costs $10. 
>  * Instead of having _Bob_ pay _Alice_ $10 and _Charlie_ pay _Bob_ $10, SplitLah simplifies this
>    so _Charlie_ just has to pay $10 directly to _Alice_, settling all debts in a single transaction.

<br>

**Example**
* Displays a session summary that summarises the [session that has been created](#creating-a-session-session-create)
  with session unique identifier of _1_ to help _Alice_ and _Bob_ calculate what transactions they have to make to
  resolve all their debts to each other.<br><br>
  `session /summary /sid 1`<br><br>

## _Group Management_
> A group represents one or more individuals. The sole purpose of a group is to quickly identify a group of individuals
> without having to manually enter their details one by one when creating a session.

### Overview
* [Creating a group: `group /create`](#creating-a-group-group-create)
* [Deleting a group: `group /delete`](#deleting-a-group-group-delete)
* [Editing a group: `group /edit`](#editing-a-group-group-edit)
* [Viewing a group: `group /view`](#viewing-a-group-group-view)
* [Listing all groups: `group /list`](#listing-all-groups-group-list)

### Creating a group: `group /create`
Creates a new group consisting of a group of individuals. You can use this group whenever creating a new session that
involves the same group of individuals. This saves you time when entering the list of participants for a session.

> Format : `group /create /n [GROUP_NAME] /pl [NAME1 NAME2 ...]`
>
>* `[GROUP_NAME]` refers to the name of the group.
>    * The group name is **case-insensitive**.
>* `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` refers to a list of individuals in the group.
>    * Each individual name is **case-insensitive**.

<br>

> **💡 Notes:**
>* The `[GROUP_NAME]` should be unique across all existing groups.
>* Each name in `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` for a particular group should be unique.
>* The names in `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` must only be a single word without whitespaces.
   >  * Example: `Alice Tan` is not allowed.

<br>

**Example**:
- Adds a new group named _Uni Friends_, consisting of _Sally, Emily, David, Uriel, Natalie, Daniel, Nathan, Ethan_ and _Sam_.<br><br>
  `group /create /n Uni Friends /pl Sally Emily David Uriel Natalie Daniel Nathan Ethan Sam` <br><br>

### Deleting a group: `group /delete`
Deletes an existing group so that you can remove groups that you no longer need.

> Format: `group /delete /gid [GROUP_ID]`
>
>* `[GROUP_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the group.
>    * The unique identifier for a group can be retrieved with the [`group /list`](#listing-all-groups-group-list) command.

<br>

> **💡 Note:**
>- A group with a unique identifier of `[GROUP_ID]` has to exist before it can be removed.
>
> **⚠️Warning:**
> - This action is irreversible. The group is deleted immediately after entering this command.

<br>

**Example**:
- Removes an existing group with a unique identifier of _1_.<br><br>
  `group /delete /gid 1` <br><br>

### Editing a group: `group /edit`
Edits an existing group so that you can change the details of a group.<br>

>Format: `group /edit /gid [GROUP_ID] {/n [GROUP_NAME] /pl [NAME1 NAME2...]}`
>* `[GROUP_ID]` refers to the unique identifier of the group.
>  * The unique identifier for a group can be retrieved with the [`group /list`](#listing-all-groups-group-list) command.
>* `[GROUP_NAME]` refers to the name of the group.
>  * The group name is **case-insensitive**.
>* `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` refers to a list of individuals in the group.
>  * Each individual name is **case-insensitive**.
<br>

> **💡 Notes:**
>- A group with a unique identifier of `[GROUP_ID]` has to exist before it can be edited.
>- The `[GROUP_NAME]` should be unique across all existing groups.
>- Each name in `[NAME1 NAME2 ...]` for a particular group should be unique.
>- There are 2 editable fields: _group name_ and the _list of individuals_ in the group.
>  - At least 1 field has to be edited for the command to run.
>  - More than 1 field can be edited in a single run of the command.
>- Editing groups **does not** affect sessions.
>  - If a session has been created with the group that you are editing,
>    editing the group **does not modify** the _list of participants_ in the session.
>
> **⚠️Warning:**
> - This action is irreversible. The group is edited immediately after entering this command.

## FAQ

**Q**: Is data saved to the disk upon exit?

**A**: SplitLah 2.0 creates a save file in a folder named `data` that is created in the same directory as
`splitlah.jar`. Changes are saved whenever a `create`, `delete` or `edit` command is run.

**Q**: How do session, activity and group unique identifiers work?

**A**: Unique identifiers uniquely identify each session, activity and group separately. Once a unique identifier
has been allocated, it will not be changed nor reused.

**Q**: Is there any way I can mark a transaction that is shown using the `session /summary` command as paid?

**A**: As of now, this functionality is not supported by SplitLah. All functionalities that SplitLah supports are documented in this user guide.
You can find a summary of all available commands in the [Command Summary](#command-summary) below.
