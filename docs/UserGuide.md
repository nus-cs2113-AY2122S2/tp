that it entails. This User Guide can also be referred to as and when needed when unclear about certain features and commands.

Persons with greater technical knowledge can refer to the [Developer Guide](DeveloperGuide.md) for in-depth explanations on the
workings behind HALPMI.

### How to read the Guide?
The User Guide is structured in a way that it is straight-forward and has a logical flow. Hence it should be easy for any User
like you to get started with HALPMI immediately.

## Quick Start

### Setting Up Java

Firstly, you need to have Java 11 or above installed in your computer. If you are not sure on how to check if you have
Java 11 installed on your computer, you can refer to [Check Java](https://www.howtogeek.com/717330/how-to-check-your-java-version-on-windows-10/).

If you do not have Java already installed...
1. You can either download the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) from [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
2. Or you can download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

Once you are sure that you have Java installed, you can download the latest version of HALPMI from the releases.

### Starting up HALPMI
You can launch HALPMI directly from your Command Prompt/Terminal. Change directory to the location where you have saved the
JAR file you have downloaded from our releases. Following which you can type in `java -jar Halpmi.jar` in the command prompt to launch HALPMI.
To learn more about [Command Prompt](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/a-beginners-guide-to-the-windows-command-line/)
, [Linux Terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) and [Mac Terminal](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac)
please head to the respective help links.

If you are not ready to handle the intricacies of the Command Prompt, you can use the `.bat` file located in our repository
to launch HALPMI as well. However do note that you will have to change the PATH name included on the bat file to the PATH name
at which Halpmi.jar is located.

#### Dispensing Medicine to Patients who have appointments on that day

You can use this feature to generate the Batch IDs of the medicines that are required to be dispensed to the patient on
his appointment day. If certain medicines you wish to dispense are not in stock, HalpMi will show you a list of medicine
you are missing in the inventory. If all the required medicines are present in the inventory, HalpMi will show the list
of Medicines you have to dispense along with the Batch ID so that you can clear batches with earlier expiry dates first.

You can use this feature using the `dispense medicine` command. This command takes in the NRIC of an existing patient
followed by a list of medicine you would like to dispense.

Format: `dispense medicine /info [NRIC],[Medicine Name],[Quantity]`

Example: `dispense medicine /info S1234567A,Paracetamol,10,Aspirin,20`

You need to give at least 1 medicine to dispense.

![dispenseMedicine](photos/dispenseMedicine.jpg)

### Saving

#### Saved Data

When you start HalpMi for the first time, the following directory and files would be created:
```
data/        // Primary resource directory for HalpMi
    ├── doctor.txt   // Text file containing doctor list
    ├── patient.txt    // Text file containing patient list
    ├── medicine.txt       // Text file containing medcine list
    ├── appointment.txt    // Text file containing appointment list
    ├── doctor_date.txt       // Text file containing date of appointment for doctors
    ├── patient_date.txt       // Text file containing date of appointment for patients
    └── appointment_meds.txt    // Text file containing dispensed medicine list required for appointments

```
Do note that the directory (and by extension, the files) will be created in your terminal's
**current working directory**. Thus, it is highly recommended for you to create a new directory
with the HalpMi JAR file inside it, and run the application from the directory.

When you launch HalpMi in subsequent sessions, please ensure that you run it from the same directory
that you did when starting HalpMi for the first time.

#### Corrupt Files
If the files are corrupted, you will be prompted by HalpMi and the corrupted lines will be moved into a separate text file, with the following name.
```
data/        // Corrupted files
    ├── doctor_corrupted.txt   // Text file containing doctor list
    ├── patient_corrupted.txt    // Text file containing patient list
    ├── medicine_corrupted.txt       // Text file containing medicine list
    └── appointment_corrupted.txt    // Text file containing appointment list
```

-----------------------------------------------

## Future Versions

#### Storage
**File encryption** -> Files will be encrypted in the future. More checks for corurpted files will also be included. Current corrupted file check is a basic preliminary check.

#### Appointment
**Assign Appointment** -> Upon adding Patient Nric and Doctor Nric, an Appointment Date would be automatically assigned based on the nearest date when the Doctor is free. Current add appointment features requires manual addition of Appointment date.
