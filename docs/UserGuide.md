> list /i
-----------------------------------------------
1. Amount: $3000
   Category: Salary
-----------------------------------------------
````

<br/>

### Modify an income: `update`

Modifies an income in your income list at the specified index.   
Use the `list /i` command to view the current indexes of your income entries.

#### Format: `update /i [INDEX] /a [NEW_AMOUNT] /c [NEW_CATEGORY]`

* `[INDEX]` refers to the index of income in list in which you want to update.
    * Enter `1` if you want to update the first entry in the list.
* `[NEW_AMOUNT]` refers to the updated monthly sum received, as a whole number.
* `[NEW_CATEGORY]` refers to the supported categories of income.
    * Enter `Salary`, `Allowance`, `Investment` or `Others`.

#### Expected Outcome:

For example: `update /i 1 /a 4000 /c salary`  <br/>
Updates the first income entry on your income list to $4000 categorised as your salary.

````
> list /i
-----------------------------------------------
1. Amount: $3000
   Category: Salary
-----------------------------------------------

> update /i 1 /a 4000 /c salary
Successfully set income 1 to:
Amount: $4000
Category: Salary
````

> **💡 Note:**
> - This command is similar to the [add an income](#add-an-income-add) command.
>  - Fields that are labeled starting with NEW follow the same restrictions in [add an income](#add-an-income-add).
>  - For example: `[NEW_AMOUNT]` input has to be a whole number, similar to `[AMOUNT]`.
>- `[CATEGORY]` is **case-insensitive**.
> - Only enter `[INDEX]` that exist in your list. For example: if you have 4 incomes in your income list, specify `[INDEX]` to be a number from 1 to 4.

> **⚠️Warning⚠️**
> - `[NEW_CATEGORY]`: Any input not in the accepted list of categories will be rejected.
<br/>

### Remove an income: `delete`

Deletes an income from your income list at the specified index.  
Use the `list /i` command to view the current indexes of your income entries.

#### Format: `delete /i [INDEX]`

* `[INDEX]` refers to the index of income in your income list you want to delete.
    * Enter `1` if you want to delete the first income in your income list.

#### Expected Outcome:

For example: `delete /i 1`  <br/>
Deletes the first income entry on your income list.

````
> list /i
-----------------------------------------------
1. Amount: $4000
   Category: Salary
-----------------------------------------------

> delete /i 1
I have removed Salary from your list of income(s).
````

> **💡 Note:**
>- Only enter `[INDEX]` that exist in your list. For example: if you have 4 incomes in your income list, specify `[INDEX]` to be a number from 1 to 4.
>- Do not use `delete /i` when your income list is empty.

<br/>

## Exit MindMyMoney application: `bye`

Shuts down the MindMyMoney application.

### Format: `bye`

### Expected Outcome:

For example: `bye`  
Exits the program.

````
> bye
Bye, hope to see you again!
````

> **💡 Note**
> - Any input after the `bye` command is ignored. For example: `bye Hello World` will still exit the program.

<br/>

## Save the Data

Your MindMyMoney data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need
for you to save manually. You can view the saved contents of MindMyMoney by reading the `data.txt` file in your current
directory.

> **💡 Note:**
>- If you wish to back up your MindMyMoney data, you can copy the `data.txt` file into the folder you want to save it in.
>- To load the backup data into MindMyMoney, copy `data.txt` from the backup folder into the folder containing MindMyMoney, replacing the existing copy of `data.txt`.

### Editing the Save File
If you are experienced in using MindMyMoney, you may wish to directly edit the `data.txt` file. Below is a short
description of its format.

> **⚠️Warning⚠️**
>- Be careful when modifying `data.txt` to follow the correct format, since doing so can corrupt the data in MindMyMoney.
   > When in doubt, keep a backup, as stated above. If you are less experienced, you may use the `update` and `add`
   > commands to edit the data.
   <br/>

`data.txt` must contain the following six lines, in this order:

```
# BEGIN EXPENDITURES
# END EXPENDITURES
# BEGIN CREDIT CARDS
# END CREDIT CARDS
# BEGIN INCOME SOURCES
# END INCOME SOURCES
```

Each expenditure, credit card, and income is stored in one line between their respective `BEGIN`/`END` lines. No line
should be left blank.

Each piece of data is stored as a series of `key : value` pairs, separated by spaces. Both `key` and `value`
are enclosed in quotes. A `\"` in a key or value represents a quotation mark, while a `\\` represents a backslash.

The following are the keys required for each type of data:

- Expenditures contain `amount`, `description`, `paymentMethod`, `time`, and `category` keys.
- Credit cards contain `totalExpenditure`, `monthlyCardLimit`, `nameOfCard`, and `cashback` keys.
- Incomes contain `amount` and `category` fields.

Their meanings are the same as in the `add` commands. The `totalExpenditure` key of a credit card contains the total
amount spent using that credit card.

If a key is missing, MindMyMoney will consider the save file invalid.

Here is an example of a valid save file:

```
# BEGIN EXPENDITURES
 "amount": "3.0"  "description": "Commute"  "paymentMethod": "Cash"  "time": "08/03/2022"  "category": "Transport" 
 "amount": "1.0"  "description": "Mala"  "paymentMethod": "DBS"  "time": "30/03/2022"  "category": "Food" 
 "amount": "1.0"  "description": "Chicken rice"  "paymentMethod": "DBS"  "time": "30/03/2022"  "category": "Food"
 "amount": "1.0"  "description": "Katsudon"  "paymentMethod": "Cash"  "time": "07/03/2022"  "category": "Food"
# END EXPENDITURES
# BEGIN CREDIT CARDS
 "totalExpenditure": "2.0"  "monthlyCardLimit": "10000.0"  "nameOfCard": "DBS"  "cashback": "1.0"
 "totalExpenditure": "0.0"  "monthlyCardLimit": "20000.0"  "nameOfCard": "OCBC"  "cashback": "4.0"
# END CREDIT CARDS
# BEGIN INCOME SOURCES
 "amount": "200"  "category": "Allowance"
 "amount": "500"  "category": "Investment" 
# END INCOME SOURCES
```

## FAQ

**Q**: Why is my data not saved when I run MindMyMoney in different folders?

**A**: MindMyMoney saves data in the current directory. To ensure all the data is saved properly, run MindMyMoney only
in the _home folder_. If you wish to run MindMyMoney in different folders and still contain your data, copy
the `data.txt` file found in the current directory into a new folder where you want to run MindMyMoney in.
