## Overview

EquipmentManager is a Command Line Interface application to help with keeping track of equipment details (serial number, name,  quantity, cost, vendor, purchase date) for an AV club. It provides a clean and fast way to manage the inventory as compared to “traditional” methods such as an Excel spreadsheet.

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `EquipmentManager` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2113-F12-2/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your `EquipmentManager` application.
4. Open the command line and go to the folder mentioned above.
5. Run java -jar tp.jar
6. Type `help` to see the list of available commands.

### Introduction

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. Spaces are acceptable. However, the parameter must be enclosed in backtick.<br>
  e.g. in ``check n/`ITEM_NAME` ``, `ITEM_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as ``check n/`SM-57` ``.

* Items in square brackets are optional. <br>
  e.g. ``s/`SERIAL_NUMBER` [n/`ITEM_NAME`] [t/`TYPE`] ...`` can be used as ``s/`SM57-1` n/`SM57` t/`MICROPHONE`...`` or as ``s/`SM57-1` t/`MICROPHONE`...``.

* After the command word (e.g. `add`, `update`), parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies ``... s/`SERIAL_NUMBER` n/`ITEM_NAME`...``, ``n/`ITEM_NAME` s/`SERIAL_NUMBER` `` is also acceptable.

* Only one attribute/value can be saved per parameter. Where multiple inputs are supplied, the last parameter will be taken instead of the first one. <br>
  e.g. ``... n/`ITEM_NAME_1` n/`ITEM_NAME_2` `` will be interpreted as ``... n/`ITEM_NAME_2` ``, omitting ``n/`ITEM_NAME_1` `` entirely.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `bye` and `save`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The maximum cost supported is up to $10 million, any specified cost equal or greater than that will be displayed incorrectly.

### Adding an equipment: `add`
Adds new Equipment to the list of Equipment.

Format: ``add n/`ITEM_NAME` s/`SERIAL_NUMBER` t/`TYPE c/COST` pf/`PURCHASED_FROM` pd/`PURCHASED_DATE` ``

* The `TYPE` must be one of the following types: MICROPHONE, SPEAKER, STAND, CABLE.
* The `COST` cannot contain any symbols.  

Example of usage and output: 

``add n/`SpeakerB` s/`S1404115ASF` t/`Speaker` c/`1000` pf/`Loud_Technologies` pd/`2022-02-23` ``

Output:

```
Equipment successfully added: SpeakerB, serial number S1404115ASF
```

### Checking an equipment: `check`
Check the details of the equipments that matches the specified parameter.

Format: ``check parameter/`PARAMETER_VALUE` ``

e.g. ``check n/`ITEM_NAME` `` or ``check s/`SERIAL_NUMBER` `` or ``check t/`TYPE` ``

* Only one parameter can be used to check for a piece of equipment.

Example of usage and output:

``check n/`SpeakerB` ``

Output: 

```
Here are the equipment matching to 'SpeakerB':
1. serialNumber=S1404115ASF,itemName=SpeakerB,type=SPEAKER,cost=1000.0,purchasedFrom=Loud_Technologies,purchasedDate=2022-02-23
```

### Listing equipment: `list`
Print a list of all equipment in the inventory. If a parameter is supplied, only the equipment matching to the parameter will be printed.

Format: `list`

Example of usage and output:

`list`

Output:

```
TOTAL QUANTITY OF EQUIPMENT: 2
1. serialNumber=S89347971ASF,itemName=MicrophoneC,type=MICROPHONE,cost=2000.0,purchasedFrom=Loud_Technologies,purchasedDate=2022-01-21
2. serialNumber=S1404115ASF,itemName=SpeakerB,type=SPEAKER,cost=1000.0,purchasedFrom=Loud_Technologies,purchasedDate=2022-02-23
```

### Updating an equipment: `update`

Equipment can be updated with new information. Every parameter except serial number can be updated. 

Format: ``update s/`SERIAL_NUMBER` [n/`ITEM_NAME`] [t/`TYPE`] [c/`COST`] [pf/`PURCHASED_FROM`] [pd/`PURCHASED_DATE`]``

* The `TYPE` must be one of the following types: MICROPHONE, SPEAKER, STAND, CABLE.
* The `COST` cannot contain any symbols.

## Planned Features (Coming Soon!)

In v3.0, we will add support to:
1. Filter equipment by range for:
   * Date
   * Cost
2. Introduce additional fields to
   * Mark equipment as faulty/working
   * Add comment for equipment
3. Implement a booking system 
   * Purpose: equipment can be earmarked for an associated event to avoid scheduling conflicts from double-booking


## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?
