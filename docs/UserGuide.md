**Limitation:**
- When adding a new meeting, please add it under the **first user added**. 
- For the case above, you only need to add the new meeting for `ibra` and it will populate for `ym` as well.
- **Take note**, adding new meeting under names except 
for the first name **will be ignored**.
- This applies for editing the details of an existing meeting, please edit it under the **first user added**. 

## Current Limitation of app
- Meeting cannot span across multiple days or go past midnight. If that is the case, please create 2 separate meetings.
e.g. if I want to have a meeting from 11pm - 3am, create one for today 2300 - 2359 and another from 0000 - 0300 
for the next day. We will fix this in the next version.
- Should the user type CTRL-C, then all the existing data in the datafile and in the program will be cleared.
  We will fix this in the next version.
