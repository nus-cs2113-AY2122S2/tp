## Quick Notes

The following table describes the **formats** used in this User Guide.

| <div style="width:120px">Format</div> | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|:--------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/x`                                  | A forward slash that is appended by a letter denotes a delimiter that should be accompanied by a parameter e.g. `/n NAME`.                               |
| `PARAMETER`                           | The terms in upper casing are placeholders parameters for details to be supplied by you e.g. `add /n Alice` instead of `add /n NAME`.                    |
| `/x PARAMETER`                        | The delimiter-parameter pairs not enclosed in any brackets are compulsory inputs to be supplied by you.                                                  |
| `[/x PARAMETER]`                      | The delimiter-parameter pairs enclosed in square brackets are optional inputs that you may choose not to provide.                                        |
| <code>/p <T&#124;(any)>               | The parameters enclosed in angle brackets indicates that they have fixed values. You may choose any of the values that are separated by a vertical pipe. |

Some additional points to take note of:

* You may provide the delimiter-parameter pairs in any preferred order.
    * Example: `add /n Alice /g 2`, `add /g 2 /n Alice`
* If you wish to use a forward slash `/` in any parameters, enclose them in whitespaces or use <code>&#92;</code>
  instead.
    * Example: `Bought on / off switch` or `Bought on\off switch` as a description
* You should not include any currency symbols, and monetary values are in at most 2 decimal places. 
* Commas should be removed from monetary values provided. E.g. `10,000` will not be a valid input.
* You may provide duplicate entries such as when you have two family members with the same name. PlanITarium will track
  each of them as separate entries via indexing.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: After you exit the program, your application data will be automatically stored in a text file locally. You can
transfer the data by transferring the text file to another computer and put it in the same directory as the application
in the new computer. When the application starts up, it will automatically load the saved data in the text file. Do note
that the application running in the new computer should be the same version as the application in your previous
computer.
