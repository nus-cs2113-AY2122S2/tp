# Sherpass User Guide

## Introduction

Sherpass is a desktop application for students to manage their academic schedules and also provide a platform for them
to focus on their academic tasks.
Optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
users who can type fast will be able to plan out their tasks in a much quicker fashion compared to traditional GUI apps.

### Managing your tasks
You can add your tasks into Sherpass and get a detailed outline of your schedule. Using this schedule, you won't
have to worry ever again about forgetting tasks and missing deadlines!

Sherpass also allows you to easily add recurring tasks (e.g. classes). Simply refer to the command details for
more information.

### Study sessions
Having trouble focusing while studying? Sherpass's study sessions allow you to select study timers, inspired by the
increasingly popular [Pomodoro study sessions](https://examstudyexpert.com/pomodoro-study-method/), to help you keep track of the time whilst completing your tasks.

#### During Study sessions
Starting the study session will show you the tasks that you have planned to do for the day. You can then choose to
start one of a few default timers provided by us, or start your own custom timer. You can also choose to start a
stopwatch to keep track of how long you've been studying for, if you're unsure of how long you will need.

#### After Study sessions
After your study session, you will be prompted to mark the tasks you've completed as done. If you're still not done with
certain tasks, feel free to start another productive session!

## FAQ

**Q**: My save file is corrupted, how do I resolve this?

**A**: Sherpass will print an error message 

containing details of the corruption (e.g., missing fields, brackets). You can either modify the save file manually to
rectify the problem or allow Sherpass to create a new save file. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: You will lose all previously saved tasks if you choose the latter!

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Transfer a copy of your save file to your other device and place it in `[JAR FILE LOCATION]/data/Sherpass.json`

## Glossary

* *Parameter* - A parameter is the means by which an input is passed to the command processing program. 
In the case for Sherpass, a parameter would be a valid input that accompanies a command. 
For example, in the [`show`](#show-your-tasks-show) command,
one of the options provided is `show all`. The `all` keyword would thus be the parameter.

 
* *Extraneous* - Something that is unnecessary or irrelevant.


* *Terminal* -  A **_text-based interface_** to the computer.
In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents.
When working in a terminal, the current directory (the text just beside your text cursor) 
is called your working directory. A terminal will usually start in the top-level directory of your account.
